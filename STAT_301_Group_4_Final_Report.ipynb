    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "### 1.1. Background Information\n",
    "There are numerous studies that have indicated strong associations of coronary heart disease with a wide variety of factors, including age and sex (Lloyd-Jones, Larson, Beiser, Levy, 1999), blood pressure (Lawes, Bennett, Lewington, Rodgers, 2003), and serum cholesterol level (Law, Wald, Thompson, 1994). However, given that the majority of the given factors have significant associations with one another, such as cholesterol level with age and sex (Beckett, N., Nunes, M., & Bulpitt, C., 2000), along with the sheer quantity of potential risk factors (Hajar, 2017), it is unclear how these factors could be combined to model and predict the diagnosis of coronary heart disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2. Dataset and Project Question\n",
    "For our research project, we have selected datasets containing processed angiography data on patients in various clinics in 1988, applying a probability model derived from test results of 303 patients at the Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland, Ohio to generate and estimate results for the diagnosis of coronary heart disease (Janosi, A., Steinbrunn, W., Pfisterer, M., & Detrano, R., 1989). The datasets include the following patients undergoing angiography: \n",
    "- 303 patients at the Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland, Ohio (Original dataset for model) \n",
    "- 425 patients at the Hungarian Institute of Cardiology in Budapest, Hungary\n",
    "- 200 patients at the Veterans Administration Medical Center in Long Beach, California \n",
    "- 143 patients from the University Hospitals in Zurich and Basel, Switzerland\n",
    "\n",
    "These datasets were retrieved from the [Heart Disease](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease) dataset from UCI machine learning repository, and converted from .data files to CSV files with Excel. The dataset obtained contains the following 14 attributes out of 76 attributes from the initial dataset for each patient: "

    "Our project question is:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### “Given the sample data for angiography patients, what model would be most effective in predicting each patient’s diagnosis?”\n",
    "\n",
    "Our analysis will involve the development of a predictive model to estimate the likelihood of angiographic coronary disease based on these variables. Additionally, we will explore regional variations and demographic influences on heart disease risk. This research question is primarily focused on both predictions, as we seek to generate a predictive model given the provided data to estimate diagnoses of new observations. Inference will also be required to a lesser extent, as we aim to gain insights into the factors influencing the likelihood of coronary disease diagnosis in different locations and demographic groups.
